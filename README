What is teamestimate?
--------------------

It is a simple script written in Ruby to determine the estimation time of a
Redmine ticket using the whole team.



How does it work?
-----------------

Every team member enters a concealed estimation in a random order. The
calculated average (i.e. the team estimation) or a manually adapted value will
then be saved to the 'Estimation time' field of the Redmine ticket with the
given ID. The script also saves the individual estimations of the team members
as a ticket note.



How can I use it?
-----------------

You need to install the Ruby libraries activeresource and highline.

Then use it like this:
